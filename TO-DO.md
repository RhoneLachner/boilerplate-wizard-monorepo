Boilerplate Wizard Monorepo Analysis
Current Architecture & How It Works
🎯 Goal: Create a system where users can quickly scaffold React/Next.js projects with different configurations using npm create commands.
✅ What's Complete: React + JS Template
The React + JS template (packages/cli/templates/react-js/) is fully implemented and impressive:
🏗️ Complete Tech Stack:
React 18.2.0 with modern hooks
Vite 5.0.0 for fast development and building
React Router 6 for client-side routing
Testing Suite: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier
Professional Structure: Components, pages, layouts
🧪 Testing Setup:
Unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library
E2E tests with Playwright
Code coverage reporting
Component testing (Button, Card, etc.)
🎨 UI/UX:
Clean, modern layout with Navigation
Responsive design
Professional branding and styling
About/Home pages with routing
❌ What's Missing
CLI Implementation: The core packages/cli/bin/create.js is empty
Other Templates: React+TS, Next+JS, Next+TS directories are empty
Publishing Setup: No npm publishing configuration
Workspace Config: pnpm-workspace.yaml is empty
Documentation: Main README is empty
🚀 Intended User Experience
```
# Users should be able to run:
npm create bp-wizard-react-js my-app
npm create bp-wizard-react-ts my-app
npm create bp-wizard-next-js my-app
npm create bp-wizard-next-ts my-app

# This would:
# 1. Download the appropriate template
# 2. Copy files to new directory
# 3. Install dependencies
# 4. Ready to run!
```

 What Needs to Be Built
CLI Tool: Implement the actual creation logic in packages/cli/bin/create.js
Complete Templates: Build React+TS, Next+JS, Next+TS based on the React+JS pattern
Publishing Setup: Configure packages for npm publishing
Workspace Configuration: Set up proper pnpm workspace
Documentation: Write comprehensive README files
💡 Recommended Next Steps
Implement CLI first - This is the core functionality
Set up publishing workflow - So you can test the npm create flow
Complete remaining templates - Copy and adapt the React+JS structure
Add monorepo documentation - Explain the architecture and usage
The foundation is solid with the completed React+JS template showing excellent practices. The architecture is well-designed for extensibility - each template is self-contained and the CLI will handle the scaffolding logic.
Would you like me to help implement any specific part of this system?

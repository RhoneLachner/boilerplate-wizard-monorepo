## What's Inside

- **Next.js** with App Router (latest version)
- **React** with modern features
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** and **Static site generation (SSG)**
- **ESLint** & **Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Jest** for unit testing with Next.js support
- **Playwright** for end‑to‑end testing
- Standard CSS setup with sensible defaults

> All dependencies use the latest compatible versions at the time of project creation.

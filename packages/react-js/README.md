# BP Wizard React JS

A minimal, batteries‑included React boilerplate designed to get you up and running in seconds.

## What's Inside

- **React** (latest version)
- **Vite** with hot‑module replacement
- **React Router** for client‑side routing
- **ESLint** & **Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **Playwright** for end‑to‑end testing
- Standard CSS setup with sensible defaults

> All dependencies use the latest compatible versions at the time of project creation.

Create your new React + JavaScript project:

```bash
npm install -g bp-wizard-create-react-js
bp-wizard-create-react-js your-app-name-here
cd your-app-name-here

Or use npx for one-time usage:

```bash
npx bp-wizard-create-react-js your-app-name-here
cd your-app-name-here
npm run dev
```

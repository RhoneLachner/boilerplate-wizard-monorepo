A minimal, batteries‑included React boilerplate designed to get you up and running in seconds.

## What's Inside

- **React 18.2.0**
- **Vite 5.0.0** with hot‑module replacement
- **React Router 6.20.1** for client‑side routing
- **ESLint 8.53.0** & **Prettier 3.1.0** for code quality and formatting
- **Vitest 1.0.4** for unit testing
- **Playwright 1.40.1** for end‑to‑end testing

Or use npx for one-time usage:

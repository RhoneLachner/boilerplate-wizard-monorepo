# BP Wizard React JS

A minimal, batteries‑included React boilerplate designed to get you up and running in seconds.

## What’s Inside

- **React** (latest version)
- **Vite** with hot‑module replacement
- **React Router** for client‑side routing
- **ESLint** & **Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **Playwright** for end‑to‑end testing
- Standard CSS setup with sensible defaults

> All dependencies use the latest compatible versions at the time of project creation.
